## The Callback Pattern

Callbacks are the materialization of the handlers of the **reactor pattern**.

They are functions that are invoked to propagate the result of an operation _and this is exactly what we need when dealing with asynchronous operations._

- They replace the use of `return` instruction that always executes synchronously.

> JavaScript is a great language to represent callbacks, because as we have seen, functions are first class objects and can be easily assigned to variables, passed as arguments, returned from another function invocation or stored into data structures.  Another ideal construct for implementing callbacks is closures. With closures, we can in fact reference the environment in which a function was created; we can always maintain the context in which the asynchronous operation was requested**, no matter when or where its callback is invoked.

The presence of a callback in a function signature do not always signify asynchronous behavior. Callbacks can perform one of two purposes:

1. A means to propagate the result of an asynchronous operation to a handler responsible for processing the operation's result
2. Consider `let doubles = [1,2,3,4].map( num => num*2)`here the callback simply provides the operation to be performed on each element in the array.

## Listening for Events

### Signals

The Node process object exposes standard **POSIX** signal names, such that a Node process can subscribe to these system events.​

### child process communication

### filesystem change events

### deferred execution
